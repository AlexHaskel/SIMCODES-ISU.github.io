# About Me

Dr. Ryan Richard is a scientist at Ames National Laboratory and an adjunct 
assistant professor of chemistry at Iowa State University. Ryan is the chief
architect and lead developer of 
[NWChemEx](https://github.com/NWChemEx/NWChemEx). He is also the PI of several
other software packages including 
[GhostFragment](https://github.com/rmrresearch/GhostFragment) and
[CMinx](https://github.com/CMakePP/CMinx). Ryan's research interests include 
research software engineering, high-performance quantum chemistry, and method 
development. 

# Why I Like My Research

I first encountered ab initio chemistry after taking undergraduate organic 
chemistry. Having just finished memorizing 100+ reactions the promise that, by
solving some physics equations, a software package could compute the same 
chemical reactions was a welcome thought. While theoretically possible, the 
reality is modern computational chemistry software is not yet at this point for 
most chemical reactions. Faced with this realization I decided it was
easier to increase the applicability of the software than to start memorizing 
more reactions.

I like my research because it is a challenging problem that keeps me thinking. 
I learn new things every day. Slowly but surely I get to see the
applicability of ab initio chemistry increase and believe that some day it
will be routinely applicable to most of chemistry. In the meantime, 
computational chemistry offers one of the more straightforward means of gaining
mechanistic insight into chemical reactions and programs like NWChemEx are
widely used for this purpose.  

# Success in My Group

My research is highly inter-disciplinary and involves contributions from
chemistry, physics, mathematics, computer science, and software engineering.
These topics are unavoidable. Students do not need to be experts in these
topics, but they can not be afraid to learn them and work through them when
they are encountered. At the same time given the complexity of the equations,
the only feasible manner of obtaining solutions is with custom software. Thus
software development is also unavoidable. Again, you do not need to be an
expert beforehand, but you will need to be willing to learn.

Ideal skills:

- A strong math background including pre-calculus, if not calculus.
- Well organized (we deal with a lot of data and it is essential to keep it
  all straight).
- Ability to think critically about problems (debugging software is an
  exercise in logic).  
- Basic computer skills. Experience writing software is a huge plus, but the
  REU program will teach you.
