# About Me

Dr. Mengdi Huai is currently an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Iowa State University. Her research interests are in the areas of data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI). Currently, her work focuses on Responsible AI, where she investigates how to identify risks and develop mitigation strategies throughout the data mining and machine learning lifecycles. This includes exploring key aspects of trustworthiness, such as uncertainty, model interpretability, security and robustness, fairness, and privacy. Additionally, she is also interested in designing effective data mining and machine learning algorithms to deal with complex data with both strong empirical performance and theoretical guarantees.

# Why I Like My Research

I hope I can use my knowledge to solve practical problems and change people’s lives for the better. My current research mainly focuses on developing novel techniques to make machine learning more trustworthy. Machine learning has been applied widely to build intelligent systems, such as self-driving cars, intelligent recommendation systems and clinical decision support systems. However, in the real world, these systems suffer from a trust crisis due to the lack of transparency behind their behaviors. The concern about the “black box” nature of machine learning models makes decision-makers reluctant to trust the predicted results, especially when the models are used for making critical decisions. In the future, I hope I can address this challenge and help people benefit from machine learning-based intelligent systems. 

# Success in My Group

Success in my group is driven by curiosity, hard work, collaboration, and shared goals. Each student in my group has unique strengths, creating a diverse skill set that enhances our overall effectiveness. We celebrate each achievement, big or small, fostering an environment where everyone feels valued and motivated. Open communication is key; we regularly share feedback and ideas, allowing us to learn from one another and adapt as needed. This synergy not only drives us toward our objectives but also strengthens our bonds, making our group a space where individual growth and collective success go hand in hand.


# Example Research Projects

Some of the research projects REU students can work on with me include:

## Model Transparency for Predictive Models

Users usually treat a machine model as a black box due to its incomprehensible functions and complex working mechanism. The “black box” nature of machine learning models may impede decision makers from trusting the predicted results, especially when the model is used for making critical decisions (e.g., medical disease diagnosis), because the consequences may be catastrophic if the predictions are acted upon blind faith. In general, transparent machine learning models have the advantage of faithfully reflecting the model behavior during the decision-making process, which helps users examine whether a machine learning model has employed the true evidences instead of biases and reduces the likelihood of an error.


## High-Throughput Electronic Structure

Training AI/ML models require a lot of data. Electronic structure theory is an
ideal candidate for generating this data because it solves the actual underlying
physics equations and can be run on many chemical systems without the need for
costly experiments. Roughly speaking most AI/ML models need at least a thousand
data points. This is more data than you want to manipulate by hand we must
develop automated solutions.

- Design and development of workflows and associated tools. While tools for
  executing workflows exist, they are generic and additional scripts are 
  necessary to use them.
- Campaigns. With access to high-throughput electronic structure theory we need
  to assemble databases of results. It is also important that we characterize
  this data to make sure it is representative of the problem space.

These research projects are joint research efforts with (TODO: list other REU
mentors here).

## Software Development

Computational chemistry is a complicated endeavor. Computational chemistry
software must manage this complexity. NWChemEx is fairly unique among 
computational chemistry software in that it was designed from the ground up to
be high-performance, flexible, modular, and highly-customizable. This leads to
a number of unique opportunities:

- Automated tooling. NWChemEx modules have some level of reflection (the 
  ability for a software component to inspect itself at runtime). This in turn
  allows for the creation of tools for automated tasks which must be manually
  written in other software. Examples include documentation, testing, and 
  saving/loading state. 
- DevOps. Software maintenance is an ongoing battle. While modular software is
  a boon for the community, it can be a maintenance headache for the maintainer
  on account of needing to manage not just one monolithic package, but many
  separate components. Research in this area focuses on automating DevOps
  across the many components.

These research projects are joint research efforts with (TODO: list other REU
mentors here).
